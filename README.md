# Hi there! 👋 I'm a Data Analyst

I'm an entry-level Data Analyst passionate about uncovering insights from data. I recently graduated from a full-time Data Science Bootcamp at Hacktive8, where I developed strong foundations in:

- 📊 Data Analysis & Statistics  
- 🐍 Python & SQL  
- 📈 Data Visualization using Tableau and kibana   
- 🧠 Problem-solving & Critical Thinking

Previously, I interned at **PT. BFI Finance Indonesia, Tbk**, where I gained valuable experience in collaboration, communication, and time management.

I'm currently open to opportunities in data analytics where I can apply my skills, grow, and contribute to data-driven decisions.
